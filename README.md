# Resources to learn AWS Amplify

This repo is about a collection of good resources that I found to learn more about AWS Amplify, since the official docs never goes deep on details for begginers (official docs are like: "oh, you have used AWS services for while? Already know a lot? Here are some tips to learn Amplify"), any way, official docs can't help much but the contents listed here can.

## Get start

[Multiple Serverless Environments with AWS Amplify](https://read.acloud.guru/multiple-serverless-environments-with-aws-amplify-344759e1be08): will teach you and your team how to work with many amplify environments in the correct way.

[Create users groups using Amazon Cognito User Pool](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/mobile/amplify-cli-enables-creating-amazon-cognito-user-pool-groups-configuring-fine-grained-permissions-on-groups-and-adding-user-management-capabilities-to-applications/): will teach you how to create users roles and add permissions for users based on each role.
